### 4 Things of DevOps

**Ease of use**- Other teams are going to use the tools we create(they won’t use them if they aren’t user-friendly). If Devs do not use our tools then there will be delays in deployment down the line.

**Flexibility** - It can be easy to get locked into using a specific product, tool or software and then it becomes hard for the company to keep up with industry changes.(Everything the company uses should be easily changed or updated as the business needs change.

**Robustness** - We need as close to 100 % uptime as possible for our company’s services (We are responsible for achieving this as DevOps engineers).

**Cost** - Cost is often overlooked. We need to make sure the company is being as efficient as possible in it’s tech dealings. (For example how powerful a machine do we need to conduct a task ? Do we need certain servers running? etc
