## Devops and Development Environmets

## Introduction

### 4 Things of DevOps

**1.Ease of use**- Other teams are going to use the tools we create(they won’t use them if they aren’t user-friendly). If Devs do not use our tools then there will be delays in deployment down the line.

**2.Flexibility** - It can be easy to get locked into using a specific product, tool or software and then it becomes hard for the company to keep up with industry changes.(Everything the company uses should be easily changed or updated as the business needs change.

**3.Robustness** - We need as close to 100 % uptime as possible for our company’s services (We are responsible for achieving this as DevOps engineers).

**4.Cost** - Cost is often overlooked. We need to make sure the company is being as efficient as possible in it’s tech dealings. (For example how powerful a machine do we need to conduct a task ? Do we need certain servers running? etc


### ***Monotlith***
A monolithic architecture is a singular, large computing network with one code base that couples all of the business concerns together.

To make a change to this sort of application requires udating the entire stack by accessing the code base and building and deploying an updated version of the service-side interface.


# Development Environments 
Area where developers can run their code in and test it (A space on some machine that has all the tools required for testing and development).

As Devops engineers one of our jobs is to create these areas ( We have to choose the tools they use because we have to full areas in mind and we want to control it).

### What makes a good Dev environment:

1. User friendly, fast and robust
2. It should be easy to update and change if new change is required
3. It should match the production environment as closely as possible
4. It should be the same for everyone, everywhere (has to configured the same way on all the machines)
5. It should only support one application (if App1 requires version 1.1 and App 2 requires version 1.4 it will not work)

Additional notes: Do not try to mix and match!!

If App 1 needs a program and that program conflicts with a program that App2 needs.
